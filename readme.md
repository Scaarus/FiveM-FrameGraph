# FrameGraph
FrameGraph is a very simple tool for estimating render performance. It includes both a graph of your FPS over the past 10 seconds, along with a command to measure the average FPS over a given duration.

## Installation
1. Download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/Scaarus/FiveM-FrameGraph/releases) section in the sidebar.
2. Extract the contents into the `resources` folder of your server.
3. From the console (in game or online) run the command `refresh`, then `start framegraph`
4. Enjoy!
